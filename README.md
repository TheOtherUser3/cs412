# CS412 – Django Web Applications Portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio of Django-based full-stack web applications developed over the course of CS412 at Boston University. It contains both guided class examples and homework projects, progressing from introductory Django concepts to a full-scale final project.

The capstone project in this repository is the Snake Arena, located in the `/project` directory.

## Capstone Project

### `/project` - Snake Arena (Final Project)
A full-stack web application where users can:
- Create AI-controlled snakes  
- Design custom game boards  
- Run automated snake battles  
- Evaluate performance to discover optimal strategies
- View Bot leaderboards

This project represents the culmination of the course and integrates:
- Backend simulation control  
- Game state management  
- Custom board generation  
- AI behavior logic  
- Interactive web-based visualization

## Other Applications in This Repository

These projects were implemented as part of incremental learning throughout the course. Each explores a specific backend or full-stack concept.

- **`hw`**  
  Introductory “Hello World” Django application used to learn project setup and request handling.

- **`quotes`**  
  *HW1*: Quote of the Day application focusing on routing, templates, and dynamic content rendering.

- **`formdata`**  
  Class example demonstrating form submission, POST handling, and server-side validation.

- **`restaurant`**  
  *HW2*: Restaurant ordering application implementing basic form logic and order processing.

- **`blog`**  
  Class example blog application focused on models, views, and relational data handling.

- **`mini_insta`**  
  *HW3+*: A mini Instagram-style application featuring:
  - User accounts  
  - Image posting  
  - Feed generation  
  - Liking and Following
  This is one of the most substantial projects in the repository outside of the final project.

- **`marathon_analytics`**  
  Class example analytics application focused on querying and displaying structured data.

- **`voter_analytics`**  
  *HW8*: Voter analytics application that reads and processes CSV datasets to analyze voter distributions and trends with a search feature.

- **`rest_framework`**  
  Class example introducing Django REST Framework concepts and API construction.

- **`dadjokes`**  
  *HW10*: A lightweight application that exposes external APIs to display dynamically fetched content.
